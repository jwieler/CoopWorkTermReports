            <h2 class="section-heading">Information About the Employer</h2>
          <p>Adknown is a small ad-tech business based in Guelph, ON. From its humble beginnings in 2011 with a total of three employees, it has grown quite a bit.</p>

          <p>Adknown is a web and app publisher which are optimized to draw traffic to their portfolio of the websites and apps.  They host a wide variety of apps and sites, for just about any demographic. </p>

          <p>Adknown uses their “understanding of concepts like Big Data, retargeting, algorithmic learning, and user fingerprinting allow us to fully leverage our proprietary RTB (Real Time Bidder) and analytics suites” (<a href="https://www.adknown.com/about/">https://www.adknown.com/about/</a>) which allows them to get a leg-up on the competition. Their use of Advertising Technology has allowed them to grow significantly from where they started. In just 10 years, they have a team of over 40 people, including engineers, data analysts, marketers, writers, and editors. This growth also allowed them to support Co-op students, like myself.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Job Description</h2>
          
          <p>I worked as a Software Engineering Intern from January 2021 – August 2021. My position was completely remote, which comes with its own set of challenges. As a Software Engineering Intern, I was able to work on a wide variety of projects, allowing me to develop my skills in many different areas.</p>

          <p>Problem solving and communication skills are assets for this role, especially if the position is remote. Since the work is remote, no one will be directly available for questions most of the time (i.e. you don’t have a desk buddy, and can’t walk down the hall to ask your project manager a question). So, you’ll need to know how and when to ask the right questions.</p>

          <p>This was not my first completely remote position, so I had some experience going into it. However, this was my first Software Engineering role, so the onboarding process was challenging (i.e. learning new systems, a new language, only seeing my team through virtual meetings, etc). Despite this, my time at Adknown was made as smooth as possible, thanks to a great team, and very hardworking management team.</p>

          <p>My main duties were to address tickets and solve problems, add features, or modify old features in the internal systems, or our external sites (I was not a part of the game dev team, so I did not work on any of the games that Adknown develops). Adknown’s development team follows the Agile methodology with daily stand-up meetings and longer weekly meetings. Languages I was able to use with Adknown included JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Goals</h2>
          <p>Throughout my term, I had a set of goals that I tried to reach. I set a total of three goals for myself: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>1. 	
                	CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Depth & Breadth of Understanding
                </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>To develop my backend programming skills.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>2.	PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR – Teamwork</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>-	Improve my ability to work as a team on tasks, especially remotely.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>3. 	
                  COMMUNICATING - Reading Comprehension
                </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Improve my ability to understand tickets/written documentation.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>I was able to successfully develop these skills and reach these goals throughout 
            the work term with the help of my amazing team.</p>

            <p>Goal 1:</p>
            <p>
              This role allowed me to work on many different projects, thus allowing me to develop many different skillsets. Going into the role, most of my experience had been front-end development, so I was less familiar with back-end development. I was able to work on many back-end tasks, as well as read and play around with existing back-end code. This allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the back-end structure and allowed me to build off it, and fix anything that needed fixing. At Adknown, the backend is written in PHP – a language I had no experience with going into this role. I am glad I was given the opportunity to work on this portion of the systems, since in my experience, I learn best by problem solving (i.e., working with the system, seeing what works and what doesn’t). I am happy to say that my backend skills improved drastically from when I first started.
            </p>

            <p>Goal 2:</p>
            <p>
              Working at a new company in a new role is always challenging to begin with, but this position being completely remote made that even more obvious. The onboarding process is inherently more difficult online for several factors (unstable internet, no in-person interactions, household distractions etc.). However, this is a great opportunity to fine tune my teamwork skills. This 8-month work term was a fantastic opportunity for growth, I was able to work on new systems, and even work with a new (to me) language. All of this can be made much smoother with good teamwork skills. One thing I came to appreciate during this time is the value of a good team. If I was ever confused or struggling with something, I had quite a few people I could reach out to who would be able and willing to help. This makes new projects and tasks much less intimidating as it gives you the confidence to go forward. Without good teamwork skills, working remotely would be nearly impossible. I was lucky to find such a good team at Adknown who helped me develop my teamwork skills.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another thing I realized about teams and teamwork is the value of a team’s collective knowledge. A team altogether has a vast breadth of knowledge spanning many topics. This is made up of individuals each with their own knowledge and experience. Being able to share this knowledge with the team creates a better team. This realization helped me to develop my teamwork skills, as I realized that if I don’t know something, perhaps a teammate knows, or at least knows where to get that info. My teamwork skills weren’t so one-sided either, I was able to gain the confidence needed to help my teammates and share my knowledge with them when applicable.
            </p>

            <p>
              Goal 3:</p>
              <p>
                Reading comprehension has been a skill I want to develop for a long time. I struggle with long-form text occasionally. I will miss small details in large tasks and will need to go back and fix those issues when they are pointed out to me. This seems obvious to me in hindsight during the review of these issues, but I don’t know why I would’ve missed them. This role was a great opportunity to work on this since I was given many tickets and tasks using long-form text descriptions. As I have mentioned previously, I learn best through experience, so, finishing tickets and thoroughly reading them to ensure I did not miss any details was the key to developing this skill. I was also able to develop this skill by reading technical documentation regarding frameworks we were using at the time. Being able to read and understand the documentation of a particular tool or framework you are using is paramount when implementing said tool/framework. I was able to implement several tools/frameworks through the documentation provided, allowing me to develop my reading comprehension skills. I am happy to say that my reading comprehension improved with each task and documentation that I read.
            </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Acknowledgements</h2>

          <p>I would like to thank everyone at Adknown for making my experience so amazing. Special thanks to the development team, my supervisor, and my project managers for giving me the opportunity to excel and develop my skills. I am truly thankful for this opportunity.
