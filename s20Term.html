            <h2 class="section-heading">Information About the Employer</h2>
          <p>The University of Guelph is a comprehensive public research university in Guelph, Ontario. Established in 1964, it has grown to an institution of more than 32,000 students. The veterinary program at the University was ranked 4th in the world in Maclean’s “University Rankings 2018”. </p>

          <p>The University offers more than 90 majors contained in 13 degree programs and 63 distance education opportunities. Personally, I am enrolled in the Bachelor of Computing Software Engineering Co-op program at the University. I am in my third academic year and am also pursuing a minor in Mathematics.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Job Description</h2>
          
          <p>I worked as a Research Assistant from June 2020 – August 2020. In this role I assisted my research team in many tasks related to our research project. Some of these tasks included reading up on research material, searching for more relevant articles, compiling data, developing a front-end web application, developing our software model, and more.</p>

          <p>Initiative and motivation are key assets for this position, as most of the work done is individual, so, you need to keep yourself focused and motivated. This is especially relevant for summer 2020, as this was during the Coronavirus pandemic, meaning this position was done remotely.</p>

          <p>Adapting to a research position was easier than I expected. I believe this is the case as a lot of the work is like schoolwork, researching the problems at hand, learning the best ways to solve them, implement the solution, and verify it works. I was lucky enough to work on a research team full of great people who were caring and willing to help. This made my time with the University of Guelph as a research assistant overwhelmingly positive.</p>

            <p>Our research was focused on student retention rates in post-secondary education and how they are affected by policy changes related to COVID-19. More specifically, we were looking for diversity changes over time and how different sub populations would be disproportionately affected by these policy changes. We do so by using a compartmental model to simulate the student retention rates over time. My main role in this project was to develop the web application that would allow the research team to easily visualize and play with the data (modify input parameters and such) to see the outcomes in real time. I used plotly, a Python framework, and Dash (a web framework for plotly) to develop the web application for the research team. I also documented the code for the team and anybody who takes on my role in the future.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Goals</h2>
          <p>Throughout my term, I had a set of goals that I tried to reach. I set a total of three goals for myself: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>1. 	
                LITERACY - Technological Literacy
                </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Write comprehensive documentation that is easy to follow</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>2. CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Problem Solving</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>	Simulation Modelling and analysis using data science techniques</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>3. 	
                CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Inquiry & Analysis
                </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>	Algorithm Testing</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>I was able to successfully develop these skills and reach these goals throughout 
            the work term with the help of my amazing research team.</p>

            <p>Goal 1:</p>
            <p>
              This position required me to write thorough documentation on all the code that I wrote so that another person could easily continue my work from where I left off after my term was up. I compiled my technical document to contain the entirety of my project, including how our compartmental model was built and how the web application was programmed. The documentation included function definitions, including parameter lists, return types and all information needed. It also outlined control flow, file structure and layout, as well as prerequisites and sources to documentation for supporting libraries. The documentation was written with the idea that someone else should read it and have enough knowledge about the inner workings of the project to continue where I left off.
            </p>

            <p>Goal 2:</p>
            <p>
              Prior to this position, I had no experience with software modelling and limited experience with data science technologies/techniques. Throughout this role, I was able to learn many software simulation modelling and analysis. We simulated a compartmental model in Python using numpy and plotly all from scratch. We defined out compartments for our model, defined the flow from compartment to compartment. From there, we researched ways to calculate the populations at each time step in the model. First, we looked at using differential equations, so we used a supporting library to calculate those. The problem with that was, this library was a black box to us, so, we didn’t know exactly what was going on in the calculations. This was a problem, as our values seemed to be a bit off, and we couldn’t see why. So, we decided to calculate our populations parametrically. We programmed this from scratch, and this allowed us to have full control over our calculations. Once we got that sorted out, we could append all of this data into a scatter plot using plotly for visualization.
            </p>

            <p>
              Goal 3:</p>
              <p>
                Developing the compartmental model and the web application have their fair share of algorithms that are required to be used for the project to come to life. The model needs to be calculated properly; it needs to be re-rendered properly with the correct parameter adjustments. The most critical one is obviously the compartmental model calculations. For this to be verified, the team needed to hand calculate the populations for each compartment for a set time period, run the simulation, and see if they line up. This must be done for a variety of cases so that we can be confident that the model is accurate.  Thorough testing of the algorithms must be done for us to be confident that every part is working properly. This role allowed me to develop this skill in a very practical manner.
            </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Acknowledgements</h2>

          <p>I would like to thank my team members at the University of Guelph for giving me this oppurtunity and allowing my transition to remote work be as smooth as possible.
