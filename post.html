            <h2 class="section-heading">Information About the Employer</h2>
          <p>The Co-operators are a cooperative insurance company consisting of: The Co-operators Group Limited, Co-operators Financial Services Limited, 
            Co-operators General Insurance Company, Co-operators Life Insurance Company, CUMIS, The CUMIS group limited, The Edge Benefits, Addenda Capital Inc., 
            The Sovereign General Insurance Company, The Premier group of companies, Technicost, Federated Agencies Limited, and HB Group Insurance Management Ltd. 
            and COSECO Insurance Company. I worked at the head office located in downtown Guelph, ON. The Co-operators offers a diverse workplace atmosphere, 
            your coworkers include all types of people with all sorts of educational backgrounds. The Co-operators includes graphic designers, software developers, 
            insurance advisors, and pretty much everything in between.</p>

          <p>Insurance is not inherently a computer science related field, but many aspects of computer science
             are used in the company to increase productivity. The company uses things like robotic process automation 
             to increase productivity, however, my role as a Technical Support Analyst gave me a unique insight into the 
             field of Computer Science. Through this role I was able to see what end users often struggled with when they 
             were using software and where software tends to fail. This viewpoint is very valuable for a Software Development 
             team, as often times developers will have varying degrees of bias when designing software. A developer can often
              make assumptions about their end users that might not be entirely true. A developer might think that their 
              application is user friendly because they know how it works, but, they were the ones working on the software, 
              so there knowledge will far surpass that of the majority of end users that will be using the software. Being a 
              Technical Support Analyst at an insurance company, I gained a valuable perspective on Software Design.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Job Description</h2>
          
          <p>I worked as a Technical Support Analyst at The Co-operators from May 2019 – December 2019. In this role, 
            I provided technical support to Co-operators employees who were having a wide variety of technical issues. 
            Issues ranged anywhere from laptops not turning on to potential viruses. Through my experiences in this role, 
            I gained many valuable skills and learned many important lessons.</p>

          <p>Communication, customer service, and general technical knowledge are assets for this role, as your main goal 
            is to aid in client service and provide competent and coherent support to people who can have any degree of 
            technical knowledge.</p>

          <p>General technical knowledge came easy to me as the Software Engineering program is very technical, 
            and so I was made previously aware of most of the common software that is used for productivity. 
            However, companies often have proprietary software that is built to the specific needs of the company. 
            I needed to learn the software and technologies as I went throughout the role in order to be able to 
            provide an adequate level of support.</p>

            <p>Communication is a critical skill in this role, as most of the work you are doing is remote. 
              Not every person who calls in an issue will be located in the same building, or even province 
              as you. You need to be able to communicate information effectively via the phone, email or other 
              means in order to provide optimal client service. Often times, you are dealing with technical 
              issues with people who are not in the tech field, so their knowledge of more in depth computer 
              concepts can be at any level. You need to convey the necessary information that is both understandable 
              to every person’s individual level of knowledge/comfort and respectable. You cannot assume that the 
              person will know more in-depth terms/technical jargon, but you cannot be condescending in an explanation. 
              Being flexible with your communication is key. This is a concept that I had to learn as I went through 
              the role, as I was learning a lot of the technologies used at The Co-operators as I went along. 
              I needed to gain the confidence to speak to clients on the phone and explain to them what the 
              issue was and the steps that needed to be taken in order to remedy them.</p>

              <p>Customer service goes hand in hand with communication, one cannot have great customer service 
                without great communication. Clients need to know that they are being treated as a priority, and 
                that their issue will be taken care of. Providing great customer service means that you combine 
                all the necessary skills for this job. You need to have the technical knowledge to identify and 
                solve the issue, you need to be able to adequately communicate the information to the client, 
                all in a respectful, timely manner. I have had prior experience with customer service in a 
                different context, however. I worked at McDonald’s throughout my high school career and dealt 
                with customers firsthand. This is a much less technical customer service role, but many of the 
                same principles apply. You must be able to have the knowledge to satisfy the customer’s needs, 
                you need to communicate to the customer the information necessary to move to the next steps in 
                the process, all in a timely, respectful manner. My time at McDonald’s helped me to provide 
                excellent customer service, I just needed to apply these principles in a more technical context. 
                My communication skills needed to grow to expand the technical terminology and corporate formalities 
                associated with the company. My technical knowledge also needed to grow to incorporate the different 
                technologies and proprietary software used at the company. Overall, customer service is the defining 
                skill for this role, and my skills in this field have dramatically increased since starting this role.</p>

            <p>Before coming into this role, I knew very little about the physical components of a computer. This role allowed 
              me to develop my knowledge of the inner workings of a computer’s hardware. As a Software Engineering student, 
              we typically focus on software topics and design, not so much practical hardware, and in this role, people can 
              have issues with any part of their computer, either software or hardware. I developed my hardware skills and 
              gained the confidence to open up a computer and reseat components and replace parts that needed replacing.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Goals</h2>
          <p>Throughout my term, I had a set of goals that I tried to reach. I set a total of four goals for myself: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>1. COMMUNICATING - Oral Communication</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>To develop professional communication skills within an office setting. Learn to effectively 
                    communicate what is on my mind, whether it be suggestions, questions/concerns, or problems I am experiencing</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>2. CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Problem Solving</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Be able to solve various problems in varying contexts - 
                    even if I have little experience with the related content.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>3. PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR – Teamwork</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Learn to be a team player in a professional work environment. That is, to learn how to know your 
                    role or position and do your work well and on time.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                <p>4.	CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Problem Solving</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Develop some sort of automation tool/helper to automate some process or to make a 
                      process easier for the team.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>I was able to successfully develop these skills and reach these goals throughout 
            the work term with the help of my mentor and team members.</p>

            <p>Goal 1:</p>
            <p>
              This position was my first real corporate experience, professional communication is very different 
              form everyday casual communication. Learning corporate lingo and formalities was necessary to present 
              myself professionally in the workplace. One specific aspect of communication I aspired to develop was my 
              ability to ask professional questions. This is a useful skill as it is helpful to get all the information 
              you need when faced with a task or challenge. I was tasked with a stretch assignment in which I had 
              limited knowledge, so, I set up a call with the person who previously worked on the assignment so that 
              I could learn the ins and outs from them. This was a measure in my development in this area, if my professional 
              communication was not up to par, I might not have been able to acquire all of the necessary information to get 
              that project off the ground.
            </p>

            <p>Goal 2:</p>
            <p>
              Problem solving is the core of what was done day to day as a Technical Support Analyst. We are faced 
              with an issue, we must find the underlying root cause, and fix said issue. I wanted to gain knowledge 
              and experience with a wide variety of issues so that I could expand the breadth of my technical knowledge. 
              I wanted to tackle all types of issues, even those that I had little prior experience with, as those often 
              teach you the most. As a Software Engineering student, we don’t often deal a whole lot with hardware, and 
              when we do, it is often at a very high level. This role allowed me to tackle both software and hardware issues. 
              I learned a great deal of troubleshooting techniques for both hardware and software. Alongside this, I tackled 
              all of the shift duties involved with the team as well. This involved an early shift, late shift, and 
              being on-call. The different shifts all have their own specific duties (specific duties left out for 
              confidentiality). I was able to perform all of the shift duties adequately and confidently. I feel my 
              problem-solving skills have vastly improved from this position, and this will help me in any field of study 
              I pursue.
            </p>

            <p>
              Goal 3:</p>
              <p>
              When working in a team, being a team player is critical. If you are not a team player, you will not see 
              much success. Academically, most of the work I do is solo, there is very limited group work. This is not 
              the case in this role, however. Most of the things you do are as a team, or you have a team to back you up 
              in case you are struggling. This is a bit of a change in my typical working dynamic, and I wanted to develop 
              this skill, as I believe that it will help me in any professional endeavors down the road. Specifically, 
              I wanted to learn to know my role within the team and know when a responsibility, task, or idea should be 
              brought to another person/team’s attention. The idea that two heads are better than one was thoroughly 
              exemplified in this role. Often times, if I was struggling with an issue, I would have my own assumptions 
              about the issue, and would get “tunnel vision” in regard to my perspective on the issue. It usually only 
              took another pair of eyes to see what my assumptions were, or to simply gain a new perspective to get 
              another step in the process. I believe that my teamwork capabilities were definitely improved during my term.
            </p>

            <p>Goal 4:</p>
            <p>
              This was a very personal goal, as I wanted to do something outside of the day to day work of helping clients 
              with computer issues. I wanted to help the team in some way with a piece of software or a script that could 
              be useful in one way or another. I was lucky enough to be given a stretch assignment to re-build our team’s 
              stat-board. This stat-board is displayed to the entire team and showcases some useful data and stats for the 
              team. The stat-board’s main purpose was to show the currently unassigned incidents that were assigned to my 
              team. The unassigned incidents were colour-coded to represent whether or not they have breached, about to 
              breach, or have not breached the team’s service level agreement (SLA). The stat-board also displayed the 
              times in the other offices where members of the team were located so that we have a quick resource to see 
              if someone is expected to be in or out of the office at a certain time. The board also displayed the team 
              members who were assigned the certain shift duties in the current week. This was a great opportunity for 
              me to develop my professional problem-solving skills in a more technical sense, as the project was using 
              languages that I have had very little experience with from school or otherwise (PowerShell and C#). 
              I had to learn a lot of concepts as I went, and I was happy to get a stable, working product for the team. 
              I believe this project will help me in future endeavors where I have little or no prior experience.
            </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Acknowledgements</h2>

          <p>I would like to thank my team members at The Co-operators for making my transition 
            into the corporate world as easy as possible.
          </p>
          <p>I would also like to thank my mentor (name is kept for confidentiality) 
            for allowing me to grow and providing me with all of the guidance I needed 
            to be able to perform well in this role.
