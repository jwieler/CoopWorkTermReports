            <h2 class="section-heading">Information About the Employer</h2>
          <p>The Co-operators are a cooperative insurance company consisting of: The Co-operators Group Limited, Co-operators Financial Services Limited, 
            Co-operators General Insurance Company, Co-operators Life Insurance Company, CUMIS, The CUMIS group limited, The Edge Benefits, Addenda Capital Inc., 
            The Sovereign General Insurance Company, The Premier group of companies, Technicost, Federated Agencies Limited, and HB Group Insurance Management Ltd. 
            and COSECO Insurance Company. I worked at the head office located in downtown Guelph, ON. The Co-operators offers a diverse workplace atmosphere, 
            your coworkers include all types of people with all sorts of educational backgrounds. The Co-operators includes graphic designers, software developers, 
            insurance advisors, and pretty much everything in between.</p>

          <p>Insurance is not inherently a computer science related field, but many aspects of computer science
             are used in the company to increase productivity. The company uses things like robotic process automation 
             to increase productivity, however, my role as a Technical Support Analyst gave me a unique insight into the 
             field of Computer Science. Through this role I was able to see what end users often struggled with when they 
             were using software and where software tends to fail. This viewpoint is very valuable for a Software Development 
             team, as often times developers will have varying degrees of bias when designing software. A developer can often
              make assumptions about their end users that might not be entirely true. A developer might think that their 
              application is user friendly because they know how it works, but, they were the ones working on the software, 
              so there knowledge will far surpass that of the majority of end users that will be using the software. Being a 
              Technical Support Analyst at an insurance company, I gained a valuable perspective on Software Design.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Job Description</h2>
          
          <p>I worked as a Technical Support Analyst at The Co-operators from May 2019 – December 2019. In this role, 
            I provided technical support to Co-operators employees who were having a wide variety of technical issues. 
            Issues ranged anywhere from laptops not turning on to potential viruses. Through my experiences in this role, 
            I gained many valuable skills and learned many important lessons.</p>

          <p>Communication, customer service, and general technical knowledge are assets for this role, as your main goal 
            is to aid in client service and provide competent and coherent support to people who can have any degree of 
            technical knowledge.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>General technical knowledge came easy to me as the Software Engineering program is very technical, 
            and so I was made previously aware of most of the common software that is used for productivity. 
            However, companies often have proprietary software that is built to the specific needs of the company. 
            I needed to learn the software and technologies as I went throughout the role in order to be able to 
            provide an adequate level of support.</p>

            <p>Before coming into this role, I knew very little about the physical components of a computer. 
              This role allowed me to develop my knowledge of the inner workings of a computer’s hardware. 
              As a Software Engineering student, we typically focus on software topics and design, not so 
              much practical hardware.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Goals</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Acknowledgments</h2>

          <p>I would like to thank my team members at The Co-operators for making my transition 
            into the corporate world as easy as possible.
          </p>
          <p>I would also like to thank my mentor (name is kept for confidentiality) 
            for allowing me to grow and providing me with all of the guidance I needed 
            to be able to perform well in this role.
